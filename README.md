# Perceived Depth Perception In A Virtual Environment Using A Head Mounted Display

A short paper about Depth Perception in VR written during my time at BTH.

## Abstract
In order to better understand how binocular depth cues can be recreated in a virtual environment, specifically the method of rendering a scene from two slightly differently positioned cameras, a small scale experiment was set up in which test subjects where presented with a scene containing a series of cubes and asked to estimate their distance. During the experiment the distance between the virtual cameras was either increased or decreased and the user was then again asked to estimate the distance to the cubes. While the test group was small, there where some indications that a wider distance between the cameras led to the user perceiving the cubes as being closer, and a decrease in the distance between the cameras to the user perceiving the cubes as being further away.
